            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a senior computer science student who's passionate about using technology to solve complex global problems. I'm well-versed in programming languages like Python and Java, and I have a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software development.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and grow in areas like software engineering, web development, cybersecurity, and data science. I don't just want to improve my technical skills; I want to use them to create real-world solutions that make a positive impact.

My goal is to work on cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of technology. I love collaborating with diverse teams to come up with creative solutions. I believe in the potential of technology to make the world better, and I'm excited to be part of this field where opportunities are endless.

Let's connect and see how we can work together to use technology and innovation for meaningful change.</p>
